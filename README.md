# DrawingWidget
This project allows the user to draws shapes by clicking and dragging across the GUI.
The shapes include: Line, Ellipse, Triangle, Rectangle and Fractal.
The wxwidgets library is imported to create the GUI and draw shapes.

Once opened, the project shows a drawing pad with buttons, and colors at the top. The buttons include fractal, ellipse, triangle, rectangle, line, size, and color. After choosing a shape, you will have the option to choose the boldness, and color using the size and color buttons. Next you would simply click and drag your shape across the pad. After you're done with the shape, you have the option to choose another shape, or simply hit the clear button and erase all of your shapes.

Skills demonstrated in this project include: GUI design and implementation, derived classes, recursive functions, pointers and vectors.
